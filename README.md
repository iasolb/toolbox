# cloud-kit

The cloud surface: moving things between machines. If a tool's job is to get
something from one box to another, it lives here.

Its sibling is `dev-kit`, which holds what you write code WITH. The split is by
what a thing is for, not by where it runs.

## What is here

| Submodule | What it does |
|---|---|
| `machine-sync` | push and pull files between two machines over SSH, with the paths named in config instead of typed |

## Clone

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/iasolb/cloud-kit.git
```

An existing clone picks up the submodules with
`git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Related, and deliberately not here

- **`ensure-utf8`** lives in `data-kit`. `machine-sync --csv` runs it over
  transferred CSVs, resolving the installed command first, so install it with
  `pip install git+https://github.com/iasolb/data-kit.git` if you want that
  flag to do anything.
- **The data loaders and the research framework** live in `research-kit`. They
  were briefly submodules of this repo, which was a filing mistake: they are
  research tools, not transfer tools.

## Where this is going

`machine-sync` currently understands exactly two machines. The intended
replacement is a registry: register a device's SSH address under an alias, then
register named locations on that device beneath it, so a transfer names two
machines and a spot rather than a path anyone has to remember.

## Where this fits

The naming convention is `<domain>-kit`. Siblings: `dev-kit` (editor and
tooling config), `data-kit` (validation, checks, transforms), `research-kit`
(analysis framework and API wrappers), `ai-kit` (the AI tooling umbrella).
